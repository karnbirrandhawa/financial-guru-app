# Financial Guru

Financial Guru is a budgeting and expense management app developed as the portfolio project for CS 340 - Introduction to Databases.

This project demonstrates the use of Flask (Python) for web development and MySQL for backend database operations, performing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality without the use of ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy. 

It utilizes raw SQL queries to interact directly with the database, using DDL to define the database schema and DML to handle insertions, updates, and deletions.
